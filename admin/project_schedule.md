My name is Romain LESIEUR, I am DataScientest Alumni and Deputy Project Director for French Administration. I will be your project mentor during these months of training. I am very happy to meet you.



The purpose of this message is to introduce you to the different expectations of the project and its deadlines. How does a project proceed in the scope of a Data Scientist training with DataScientest? Just follow these few steps.
The document Projects_methodology_reports will guide you in writing the different reports.
:arrow_right: For your information, these steps are designed to ensure that your project goes as smoothly as possible, i.e. without any last minute problems and with a final result that is up to your abilities.
The project that has been assigned to you is the following: Analysis of Covid-19 chest x-rays.

# Project Deadlines Detailed

-------------------------------------------------

## Step 0/ Framing (Our first meeting): This week




## --> Step 1/ Data mining + DataViz’: # <<<<<Deadline Thursday, December 19>>>>> 

Your first task will be to define the context and the scope of the project: I expect you to really take the time to understand the project and to learn as much as possible about the concepts it will introduce.

You will then have to take in hand and discover your dataset and make an almost exhaustive analysis of it in order to highlight the structure, the difficulties and possible biases(Verzerrungen) of the dataset.

You can use this template: TEMPLATE - Data Audit

I will also expect at least 5 graphical representations built from your dataset, visual and especially relevant. For each of them I will expect:
    
  

    -> A precise commentary, which analyzes the figure and provides a “business” opinion.
    -> A validation of the observation by data manipulation or a statistical test.






## Step 2/ Pre-processing and feature engineering : <<<<<Deadline Thursday, January 23>>>>>

Following the observations made in the previous step, you will have to clean your dataset and perform the pre-processing steps.

If necessary, you will have to transform and/or add features and enrich your dataset.

The objective at the end of this step is to have a dataset ready to perform in-depth analysis and/or modeling using Machine (and Deep) Learning.

# Rendering 1: data exploration, data visualization and pre-processing report.

After rendering 1, if not already done, I will instantiate a GitHub repo for your group, which will have to respect the template provided and be sent to the jury with the final report.

## Step 3/ Modeling :  <<<<<<<<<Deadline Thursday, April 24>>>>>>>>>

## Step 1 : <<<<<<<<<Deadline Thursday, February 20>>>>>>>>>

Elaboration of the first modeling iterations with baseline models.
Analyze your first results, is your approach relevant? And your model?

## Step 2 : <<<<<<<<<<Deadline Thursday, March 20>>>>>>>>>>

Use Machine Learning and statistical metrics to better understand the results of your model.
Optimization: Try to improve your model with optimization tools, you can try other more complex models and compare the results.

## Step 3 : <<<<<<<<<Deadline Thursday, April 24>>>>>>>>>

Advanced modeling: Use bagging/boosting and Deep Learning techniques.
Interpretation: Use the interpretability tools to better understand the results of your models.
Scientific and business conclusions based on the success or failure of the modeling.

# Rendering 2: Modeling report.

## Step 5/ Final report + codes on GitHub :  <<<<<<<<<Deadline Thursday, May 21>>>>>>>>>
You will submit the final report: made up of the first two renderings, it concretizes your vision and your work on your project by integrating a conclusion and an opening.
You also turn in your clean and commented code on GitHub, if time allows you will be able to refine your model and modeling pipeline during this step.

## Step 6/ Streamlit + Defense: <<<<<<<Deadline Mon, 06/ 09/ 2025 ( to be confirmed )>>>>>>>
The document Defense_Methodology summarizes the defense’s organization.
The presentation will be as follows:
20 minutes of presentation
10 minutes of questions from the jury members
You have the possibility to make either :
a Powerpoint presentation + Streamlit demo
the entire presentation with your Streamlit application
Your application will have to :
be aesthetically pleasing, with several tabs
carefully coded, without re-training your model
works without bugs.
