    "# Detecting a rotated chest X-ray (CXR) image is crucial for proper medical analysis and automated diagnostics. There are several techniques that can be used to identify and correct rotated X-ray images:\n",
    "1. Deep Learning-Based Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Best for large datasets & high accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "    Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):\n",
    "        Train a CNN to classify images as \"rotated\" or \"correctly oriented.\"\n",
    "        Example architectures: ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet.\n",
    "    Autoencoders / Self-Supervised Learning:\n",
    "        An autoencoder can learn normal orientations and identify when an image is misaligned.\n",
    "        Contrastive learning (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo) can learn representations and detect rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¹ Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Train a CNN classifier on CXR images labeled with different rotation angles (e.g., 0Â°, 90Â°, 180Â°, 270Â°).\n",
    "    The model predicts whether an image is rotated and suggests corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Classical Computer Vision Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Good for small datasets & fast processing\n",
    "A. Edge Detection & Keypoint Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hough Line Transform:\n",
    "        Detects vertical and horizontal structures in X-rays.\n",
    "        If the lung boundaries or clavicles are tilted, the image is likely rotated.\n",
    "    Harris Corner Detector / SIFT / ORB Features:\n",
    "        Extract keypoints (e.g., rib cage edges) and compare them with known orientations.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Symmetry-Based Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "    Lungs and spine are normally symmetrical in frontal CXR.\n",
    "    Use symmetry detection:\n",
    "        Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG)\n",
    "        Radon transform (detects dominant line orientations)\n",
    "        Fourier transform-based alignment (checks for dominant vertical structures)\n",
    "\n",
    "C. PCA (Principal Component Analysis)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Compute the principal axis of the lung region.\n",
    "    If the major axis is significantly tilted, the image is rotated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Template Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "âœ… Useful when reference images are available\n",
    "\n",
    "    Compare an input X-ray with a set of correctly aligned reference images.\n",
    "    Use cross-correlation or structural similarity index (SSIM) to measure alignment.\n",
    "    If misalignment is detected, rotate the image until it best matches the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Statistical Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "    Compute the intensity profile along the vertical axis:\n",
    "        Normally, pixel intensity distribution should be symmetrical.\n",
    "        If the distribution is skewed, the image might be rotated.\n",
    "    Gradient orientation histograms:\n",
    "        In a correctly oriented image, most gradients should be vertical.\n",
    "        Rotation causes shifts in the gradient histogram.\n",
    "\n",
